# Info

This script starts the built-in PHP-CLI Webserver for the WebUI.
You need PHP at least 5.4 to run this script!

Just execute boot.php (it's a shell-script).

# For Windows Users

Execute boot.exe inside the `bin` folder.

#### Portable notice

If you don't have PHP 5.4 installed yet, you can get a copy
at <http://windows.php.net/download/>.

Unpack the archive into the `bin/php` folder and write 
the path into the "boot.ini" (normaly it should look like this: bin/php/php.exe).

Thats it, you're done. 
Execute boot.exe as before.
